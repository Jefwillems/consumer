# consumer

Consumer is a nodejs CLI-tool, that is able to generate REST-api consumers for major front-end frameworks like VueJS and Angular2 and up.

The project is still very unfinished and shouldn't be used for a production environment.

For upcoming features you can check the [project board](https://github.com/Jefwillems/consumer/projects/1)
